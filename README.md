# ATM-machine

Wanted to simulate the work of real ATM machine: change language and see everything in the chosen language, enter and change PIN with fixed number of attempts, make deposits and transactions, check balance and etc.

Your PIN is "1234" (never use this in real life) and your balance is 1000 EUR.
